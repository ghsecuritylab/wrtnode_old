.SS AUDIT
This target allows to create audit records for packets hitting the target.
It can be used to record accepted, dropped, and rejected packets. See
auditd(8) for additional details.
.TP
\fB\-\-type\fP {\fBaccept\fP|\fBdrop\fP|\fBreject\fP}
Set type of audit record.
.PP
Example:
.IP
iptables \-N AUDIT_DROP
.IP
iptables \-A AUDIT_DROP \-j AUDIT \-\-type drop
.IP
iptables \-A AUDIT_DROP \-j DROP
.SS CHECKSUM
This target allows to selectively work around broken/old applications.
It can only be used in the mangle table.
.TP
\fB\-\-checksum\-fill\fP
Compute and fill in the checksum in a packet that lacks a checksum.
This is particularly useful, if you need to work around old applications
such as dhcp clients, that do not work well with checksum offloads,
but don't want to disable checksum offload in your device.
.SS CLASSIFY
This module allows you to set the skb\->priority value (and thus classify the packet into a specific CBQ class).
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-class\fP \fImajor\fP\fB:\fP\fIminor\fP
Set the major and minor class value. The values are always interpreted as
hexadecimal even if no 0x prefix is given.
.SS CLUSTERIP (IPv4-specific)
This module allows you to configure a simple cluster of nodes that share
a certain IP and MAC address without an explicit load balancer in front of
them.  Connections are statically distributed between the nodes in this
cluster.

\fB\-\-new\fP
Create a new ClusterIP.  You always have to set this on the first rule
for a given ClusterIP.
.TP
\fB\-\-hashmode\fP \fImode\fP

Local node number within this cluster.
.TP
\fB\-\-hash\-init\fP \fIrnd\fP

.SS CONNMARK
This module sets the netfilter mark value associated with a connection. The
mark is 32 bits wide.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zero out the bits given by \fImask\fP and XOR \fIvalue\fP into the ctmark.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-nfmask\fP \fInfmask\fP] [\fB\-\-ctmask\fP \fIctmask\fP]
Copy the packet mark (nfmark) to the connection mark (ctmark) using the given
masks. The new nfmark value is determined as follows:
.IP
ctmark = (ctmark & ~ctmask) ^ (nfmark & nfmask)
.IP
i.e. \fIctmask\fP defines what bits to clear and \fInfmask\fP what bits of the
nfmark to XOR into the ctmark. \fIctmask\fP and \fInfmask\fP default to
0xFFFFFFFF.
.TP
\fB\-\-restore\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-nfmask\fP \fInfmask\fP] [\fB\-\-ctmask\fP \fIctmask\fP]
Copy the connection mark (ctmark) to the packet mark (nfmark) using the given
masks. The new ctmark value is determined as follows:

nfmark = (nfmark & ~\fInfmask\fP) ^ (ctmark & \fIctmask\fP);
.IP
i.e. \fInfmask\fP defines what bits to clear and \fIctmask\fP what bits of the
ctmark to XOR into the nfmark. \fIctmask\fP and \fInfmask\fP default to
0xFFFFFFFF.
.IP
\fB\-\-restore\-mark\fP is only valid in the \fBmangle\fP table.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP:
.TP
\fB\-\-and\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary AND the ctmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark
0/\fP\fIinvbits\fP, where \fIinvbits\fP is the binary negation of \fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-or\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary OR the ctmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/\fP\fIbits\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-xor\-mark\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary XOR the ctmark with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-xmark\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/0\fP.)
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Set the connection mark. If a mask is specified then only those bits set in the
mask are modified.
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-mask\fP \fImask\fP]
Copy the nfmark to the ctmark. If a mask is specified, only those bits are
copied.
.TP
\fB\-\-restore\-mark\fP [\fB\-\-mask\fP \fImask\fP]
Copy the ctmark to the nfmark. If a mask is specified, only those bits are
copied. This is only valid in the \fBmangle\fP table.
.SS CONNSECMARK
This module copies security markings from packets to connections
(if unlabeled), and from connections back to packets (also only
if unlabeled).  Typically used in conjunction with SECMARK, it is
valid in the
.B security
table (for backwards compatibility with older kernels, it is also
valid in the
.B mangle
table).
.TP
\fB\-\-save\fP
If the packet has a security marking, copy it to the connection
if the connection is not marked.
.TP
\fB\-\-restore\fP
If the packet does not have a security marking, and the connection
does, copy the security marking from the connection to the packet.

.SS DNPT (IPv6-specific)
Provides stateless destination IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (as
described by RFC 6296).
.PP
You have to use this target in the
.B mangle
table, not in the
.B nat
table. It takes the following options:
.TP
\fB\-\-src\-pfx\fP [\fIprefix/\fP\fIlength]
Set source prefix that you want to translate and length
.TP
\fB\-\-dst\-pfx\fP [\fIprefix/\fP\fIlength]
Set destination prefix that you want to use in the translation and length
.PP
You have to use the SNPT target to undo the translation. Example:
.IP
ip6tables \-t mangle \-I POSTROUTING \-s fd00::/64 \! \-o vboxnet0
\-j SNPT \-\-src-pfx fd00::/64 \-\-dst-pfx 2001:e20:2000:40f::/64
.IP
ip6tables \-t mangle \-I PREROUTING \-i wlan0 \-d 2001:e20:2000:40f::/64
\-j DNPT \-\-src-pfx 2001:e20:2000:40f::/64 \-\-dst-pfx fd00::/64
.PP
You may need to enable IPv6 neighbor proxy:
.IP
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.proxy_ndp=1
.PP
You also have to use the
.B NOTRACK
target to disable connection tracking for translated flows.
.SS DSCP
This target allows to alter the value of the DSCP bits within the TOS
header of the IPv4 packet.  As this manipulates a packet, it can only
be used in the mangle table.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-dscp\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the DSCP field to a numerical value (can be decimal or hex)
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-dscp\-class\fP \fIclass\fP
Set the DSCP field to a DiffServ class.
.SS ECN (IPv4-specific)
This target allows to selectively work around known ECN blackholes.
It can only be used in the mangle table.
.TP
\fB\-\-ecn\-tcp\-remove\fP
Remove all ECN bits from the TCP header.  Of course, it can only be used
in conjunction with
\fB\-p tcp\fP.
.SS HL (IPv6-specific)
This is used to modify the Hop Limit field in IPv6 header. The Hop Limit field
is similar to what is known as TTL value in IPv4.  Setting or incrementing the
Hop Limit field can potentially be very dangerous, so it should be avoided at
any cost. This target is only valid in
.B mangle
table.
.PP
.B Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-set\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the Hop Limit to `value'.
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-dec\fP \fIvalue\fP
Decrement the Hop Limit `value' times.
.TP
\fB\-\-hl\-inc\fP \fIvalue\fP
Increment the Hop Limit `value' times.
.SS HMARK
Like MARK, i.e. set the fwmark, but the mark is calculated from hashing
packet selector at choice. You have also to specify the mark range and,
optionally, the offset to start from. ICMP error messages are inspected
and used to calculate the hashing.
.PP
Existing options are:
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-tuple\fP tuple\fI\fP
Possible tuple members are:
.B src
meaning source address (IPv4, IPv6 address),
.B dst
meaning destination address (IPv4, IPv6 address),
.B sport
meaning source port (TCP, UDP, UDPlite, SCTP, DCCP),
.B dport
meaning destination port (TCP, UDP, UDPlite, SCTP, DCCP),
.B spi
meaning Security Parameter Index (AH, ESP), and
.B ct
meaning the usage of the conntrack tuple instead of the packet selectors.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-mod\fP \fIvalue (must be > 0)\fP
Modulus for hash calculation (to limit the range of possible marks)
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-offset\fP \fIvalue\fP
Offset to start marks from.
.TP
For advanced usage, instead of using \-\-hmark\-tuple, you can specify custom
prefixes and masks:
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-src\-prefix\fP \fIcidr\fP
The source address mask in CIDR notation.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-dst\-prefix\fP \fIcidr\fP
The destination address mask in CIDR notation.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-sport\-mask\fP \fIvalue\fP
A 16 bit source port mask in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-dport\-mask\fP \fIvalue\fP
A 16 bit destination port mask in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-spi\-mask\fP \fIvalue\fP
A 32 bit field with spi mask.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-proto\-mask\fP \fIvalue\fP
An 8 bit field with layer 4 protocol number.
.TP
\fB\-\-hmark\-rnd\fP \fIvalue\fP
A 32 bit random custom value to feed hash calculation.

.SS IDLETIMER
This target can be used to identify when interfaces have been idle for a
certain period of time.  Timers are identified by labels and are created when
a rule is set with a new label.  The rules also take a timeout value (in
seconds) as an option.  If more than one rule uses the same timer label, the
timer will be restarted whenever any of the rules get a hit.  One entry for
each timer is created in sysfs.  This attribute contains the timer remaining
for the timer to expire.  The attributes are located under the xt_idletimer
class:
.PP
/sys/class/xt_idletimer/timers/<label>
.PP
When the timer expires, the target module sends a sysfs notification to the
userspace, which can then decide what to do (eg. disconnect to save power).
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout\fP \fIamount\fP
This is the time in seconds that will trigger the notification.
.TP
\fB\-\-label\fP \fIstring\fP
This is a unique identifier for the timer.  The maximum length for the
label string is 27 characters.
.SS LED
This creates an LED-trigger that can then be attached to system indicator
lights, to blink or illuminate them when certain packets pass through the
system. One example might be to light up an LED for a few minutes every time
an SSH connection is made to the local machine. The following options control
the trigger behavior:
.TP
\fB\-\-led\-trigger\-id\fP \fIname\fP
This is the name given to the LED trigger. The actual name of the trigger
will be prefixed with "netfilter-".
.TP
\fB\-\-led-delay\fP \fIms\fP
This indicates how long (in milliseconds) the LED should be left illuminated
when a packet arrives before being switched off again. The default is 0
(blink as fast as possible.) The special value \fIinf\fP can be given to
leave the LED on permanently once activated. (In this case the trigger will
need to be manually detached and reattached to the LED device to switch it
off again.)
.TP
\fB\-\-led\-always\-blink\fP
Always make the LED blink on packet arrival, even if the LED is already on.
This allows notification of new packets even with long delay values (which
otherwise would result in a silent prolonging of the delay time.)
.TP
Example:
.TP
Create an LED trigger for incoming SSH traffic:
iptables \-A INPUT \-p tcp \-\-dport 22 \-j LED \-\-led\-trigger\-id ssh
.TP
Then attach the new trigger to an LED:
echo netfilter\-ssh >/sys/class/leds/\fIledname\fP/trigger
.SS MIRROR (IPv4-specific)
This is an experimental demonstration target which inverts the source
and destination fields in the IP header and retransmits the packet.
It is only valid in the
.BR INPUT ,
.B FORWARD
and
.B PREROUTING
chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
chains.  Note that the outgoing packets are
.B NOT
seen by any packet filtering chains, connection tracking or NAT, to
avoid loops and other problems.
.SS NETMAP
This target allows you to statically map a whole network of addresses onto
another network of addresses.  It can only be used from rules in the
.B nat
table.
.TP
\fB\-\-to\fP \fIaddress\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Network address to map to.  The resulting address will be constructed in the
following way: All 'one' bits in the mask are filled in from the new `address'.
All bits that are zero in the mask are filled in from the original address.
.TP
IPv6 support available since Linux kernels >= 3.7.
.SS NFLOG
This target provides logging of matching packets. When this target is
set for a rule, the Linux kernel will pass the packet to the loaded
logging backend to log the packet. This is usually used in combination
with nfnetlink_log as logging backend, which will multicast the packet
through a
.IR netlink
socket to the specified multicast group. One or more userspace processes
may subscribe to the group to receive the packets. Like LOG, this is a
non-terminating target, i.e. rule traversal continues at the next rule.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-group\fP \fInlgroup\fP
The netlink group (0 - 2^16\-1) to which packets are (only applicable for
nfnetlink_log). The default value is 0.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-prefix\fP \fIprefix\fP
A prefix string to include in the log message, up to 64 characters
long, useful for distinguishing messages in the logs.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-range\fP \fIsize\fP
The number of bytes to be copied to userspace (only applicable for
nfnetlink_log). nfnetlink_log instances may specify their own
range, this option overrides it.
.TP
\fB\-\-nflog\-threshold\fP \fIsize\fP
Number of packets to queue inside the kernel before sending them
to userspace (only applicable for nfnetlink_log). Higher values
result in less overhead per packet, but increase delay until the
packets reach userspace. The default value is 1.
.BR
.SS NFQUEUE
This target passes the packet to userspace using the
\fBnfnetlink_queue\fP handler.  The packet is put into the queue
identified by its 16-bit queue number.  Userspace can inspect
and modify the packet if desired. Userspace must then drop or
reinject the packet into the kernel.  Please see libnetfilter_queue
for details.
.B
nfnetlink_queue
was added in Linux 2.6.14. The \fBqueue-balance\fP option was added in Linux 2.6.31,
\fBqueue-bypass\fP in 2.6.39.
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-num\fP \fIvalue\fP
This specifies the QUEUE number to use. Valid queue numbers are 0 to 65535. The default value is 0.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-balance\fP \fIvalue\fP\fB:\fP\fIvalue\fP
This specifies a range of queues to use. Packets are then balanced across the given queues.
This is useful for multicore systems: start multiple instances of the userspace program on
queues x, x+1, .. x+n and use "\-\-queue\-balance \fIx\fP\fB:\fP\fIx+n\fP".
Packets belonging to the same connection are put into the same nfqueue.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-bypass\fP
By default, if no userspace program is listening on an NFQUEUE, then all packets that are to be queued
are dropped.  When this option is used, the NFQUEUE rule behaves like ACCEPT instead, and the packet
will move on to the next table.
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-queue\-cpu-fanout\fP
Available starting Linux kernel 3.10. When used together with
\fB--queue-balance\fP this will use the CPU ID as an index to map packets to
the queues. The idea is that you can improve performance if there's a queue
per CPU. This requires \fB--queue-balance\fP to be specified.
.SS NOTRACK
This extension disables connection tracking for all packets matching that rule.
It is equivalent with \-j CT \-\-notrack. Like CT, NOTRACK can only be used in
the \fBraw\fP table.
.SS RATEEST
The RATEEST target collects statistics, performs rate estimation calculation
and saves the results for later evaluation using the \fBrateest\fP match.
.TP
\fB\-\-rateest\-name\fP \fIname\fP
Count matched packets into the pool referred to by \fIname\fP, which is freely
choosable.
.TP
\fB\-\-rateest\-interval\fP \fIamount\fP{\fBs\fP|\fBms\fP|\fBus\fP}
Rate measurement interval, in seconds, milliseconds or microseconds.
.TP
\fB\-\-rateest\-ewmalog\fP \fIvalue\fP
Rate measurement averaging time constant.
.SS SAME (IPv4-specific)
Similar to SNAT/DNAT depending on chain: it takes a range of addresses
(`\-\-to 1.2.3.4\-1.2.3.7') and gives a client the same
source-/destination-address for each connection.
.PP
N.B.: The DNAT target's \fB\-\-persistent\fP option replaced the SAME target.
.TP
\fB\-\-to\fP \fIipaddr\fP[\fB\-\fP\fIipaddr\fP]
Addresses to map source to. May be specified more than once for
multiple ranges.
.TP
\fB\-\-nodst\fP
Don't use the destination-ip in the calculations when selecting the
new source-ip
.TP
\fB\-\-random\fP
Port mapping will be forcibly randomized to avoid attacks based on 
port prediction (kernel >= 2.6.21).
.SS SECMARK
This is used to set the security mark value associated with the
packet for use by security subsystems such as SELinux.  It is
valid in the
.B security
table (for backwards compatibility with older kernels, it is also
valid in the
.B mangle
table). The mark is 32 bits wide.
.TP
\fB\-\-selctx\fP \fIsecurity_context\fP
.SS SNPT (IPv6-specific)
Provides stateless source IPv6-to-IPv6 Network Prefix Translation (as described
by RFC 6296).
.PP
You have to use this target in the
.B mangle
table, not in the
.B nat
table. It takes the following options:
.TP
\fB\-\-src\-pfx\fP [\fIprefix/\fP\fIlength]
Set source prefix that you want to translate and length
.TP
\fB\-\-dst\-pfx\fP [\fIprefix/\fP\fIlength]
Set destination prefix that you want to use in the translation and length
.PP
You have to use the DNPT target to undo the translation. Example:
.IP
ip6tables \-t mangle \-I POSTROUTING \-s fd00::/64 \! \-o vboxnet0
\-j SNPT \-\-src-pfx fd00::/64 \-\-dst-pfx 2001:e20:2000:40f::/64

.PP
You may need to enable IPv6 neighbor proxy:
.IP
sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.proxy_ndp=1
.PP
You also have to use the
.B NOTRACK
target to disable connection tracking for translated flows.
.SS TCPOPTSTRIP
This target will strip TCP options off a TCP packet. (It will actually replace
them by NO-OPs.) As such, you will need to add the \fB\-p tcp\fP parameters.
.TP
\fB\-\-strip\-options\fP \fIoption\fP[\fB,\fP\fIoption\fP...]
Strip the given option(s). The options may be specified by TCP option number or
by symbolic name. The list of recognized options can be obtained by calling
iptables with \fB\-j TCPOPTSTRIP \-h\fP.
.SS TEE
The \fBTEE\fP target will clone a packet and redirect this clone to another
machine on the \fBlocal\fP network segment. In other words, the nexthop
must be the target, or you will have to configure the nexthop to forward it
further if so desired.
.TP
\fB\-\-gateway\fP \fIipaddr\fP
Send the cloned packet to the host reachable at the given IP address.
Use of 0.0.0.0 (for IPv4 packets) or :: (IPv6) is invalid.
.PP
To forward all incoming traffic on eth0 to an Network Layer logging box:
.PP
\-t mangle \-A PREROUTING \-i eth0 \-j TEE \-\-gateway 2001:db8::1
.SS TOS
This module sets the Type of Service field in the IPv4 header (including the
"precedence" bits) or the Priority field in the IPv6 header. Note that TOS
shares the same bits as DSCP and ECN. The TOS target is only valid in the
\fBmangle\fP table.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-tos\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Zeroes out the bits given by \fImask\fP (see NOTE below) and XORs \fIvalue\fP
into the TOS/Priority field. If \fImask\fP is omitted, 0xFF is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-\-set\-tos\fP \fIsymbol\fP
You can specify a symbolic name when using the TOS target for IPv4. It implies
a mask of 0xFF (see NOTE below). The list of recognized TOS names can be
obtained by calling iptables with \fB\-j TOS \-h\fP.
.PP
The following mnemonics are available:
.TP
\fB\-\-and\-tos\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary AND the TOS value with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-tos
0/\fP\fIinvbits\fP, where \fIinvbits\fP is the binary negation of \fIbits\fP.
See NOTE below.)
.TP
\fB\-\-or\-tos\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary OR the TOS value with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-tos\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/\fP\fIbits\fP. See NOTE below.)
.TP
\fB\-\-xor\-tos\fP \fIbits\fP
Binary XOR the TOS value with \fIbits\fP. (Mnemonic for \fB\-\-set\-tos\fP
\fIbits\fP\fB/0\fP. See NOTE below.)
.PP
NOTE: In Linux kernels up to and including 2.6.38, with the exception of
longterm releases 2.6.32 (>=.42), 2.6.33 (>=.15), and 2.6.35 (>=.14), there is
a bug whereby IPv6 TOS mangling does not behave as documented and differs from
the IPv4 version. The TOS mask indicates the bits one wants to zero out, so it
needs to be inverted before applying it to the original TOS field. However, the
aformentioned kernels forgo the inversion which breaks --set-tos and its
mnemonics.
.SS TPROXY
This target is only valid in the \fBmangle\fP table, in the \fBPREROUTING\fP
chain and user-defined chains which are only called from this chain. It
redirects the packet to a local socket without changing the packet header in
any way. It can also change the mark value which can then be used in advanced
routing rules.
It takes three options:
.TP
\fB\-\-on\-port\fP \fIport\fP
This specifies a destination port to use. It is a required option, 0 means the
new destination port is the same as the original. This is only valid if the
rule also specifies \fB\-p tcp\fP or \fB\-p udp\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-on\-ip\fP \fIaddress\fP
This specifies a destination address to use. By default the address is the IP
address of the incoming interface. This is only valid if the rule also
specifies \fB\-p tcp\fP or \fB\-p udp\fP.
.TP
\fB\-\-tproxy\-mark\fP \fIvalue\fP[\fB/\fP\fImask\fP]
Marks packets with the given value/mask. The fwmark value set here can be used
by advanced routing. (Required for transparent proxying to work: otherwise
these packets will get forwarded, which is probably not what you want.)
.SS TRACE
This target marks packets so that the kernel will log every rule which match 
the packets as those traverse the tables, chains, rules.
.PP
A logging backend, such as ip(6)t_LOG or nfnetlink_log, must be loaded for this
to be visible.
The packets are logged with the string prefix:
"TRACE: tablename:chainname:type:rulenum " where type can be "rule" for 
plain rule, "return" for implicit rule at the end of a user defined chain 
and "policy" for the policy of the built in chains. 
.br
It can only be used in the
.BR raw
table.
.SS TTL (IPv4-specific)
This is used to modify the IPv4 TTL header field.  The TTL field determines
how many hops (routers) a packet can traverse until it's time to live is
exceeded.
.PP
Setting or incrementing the TTL field can potentially be very dangerous,
so it should be avoided at any cost. This target is only valid in
.B mangle
table.
.PP
.B Don't ever set or increment the value on packets that leave your local network!
.TP
\fB\-\-ttl\-set\fP \fIvalue\fP
Set the TTL value to `value'.
.TP
\fB\-\-ttl\-dec\fP \fIvalue\fP
Decrement the TTL value `value' times.
.TP
\fB\-\-ttl\-inc\fP \fIvalue\fP
Increment the TTL value `value' times.
.SS ULOG (IPv4-specific)
This is the deprecated ipv4-only predecessor of the NFLOG target.
It provides userspace logging of matching packets.  When this
target is set for a rule, the Linux kernel will multicast this packet
through a
.IR netlink 
socket. One or more userspace processes may then subscribe to various 
multicast groups and receive the packets.
Like LOG, this is a "non-terminating target", i.e. rule traversal
continues at the next rule.
